## How to contribute to Open Bastion

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* Check first that a similar issue is not already opened.
* If one exists and you can bring something new, please comment on the issue.
* If not, you can either create a new one on the GitHub repository or create a
  pull request with your fix proposal. We will be happy to review and integrate
  it if possible.
* As much as possible, issues should follow the issue template.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and the solution.
* Add the corresponding issue number in your commit(s).

#### **Did you fix whitesapce, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

These kinds of fix are warmly welcomed as long as they pass the tests. Also,
improving the tests to avoid these kind of fixes in the future is also greatly
appreciated!

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

All ideas or suggestions can be asked through issues in GitHub. They will be
tagged accordingly. If we accept the idea, it will be included in the backlog
and be developed for the future release.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

All questions can be asked through issues in GitHub. They will be tagged as
`question`. Again, do not forget to search for similar issues before creating
one.

Thanks! :european_castle: :key:  :heart:
